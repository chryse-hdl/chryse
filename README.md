# Chryse

A little framework to build projects in Chisel, but it might end up turning into
its own HDL depending on how much I love Scala. :)

## TODO

* Generate PCFs on demand via board descriptions.
* Parameterise correctly for ECP5.
* Remove sbtchryse if we don't need it after all.
* CXXRTL/cxxsim.
